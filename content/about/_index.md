Hi! If you have landed on this webpage, then your interests likely align with computer architecture or embedded systems.
The goal of these posts is to support theories with relevant implementations. Some of these posts will explore FPGAs, 
ARM architecture, PCIe, memory interfaces, and internal bus protocols such as AXI. Most of these posts will be 
goal-oriented. Please feel free to contact me if you need clarity about any of my posts or related topics. If you would 
like any particular topic to be discussed, please email me with the relevant subject.

Thanks :)
